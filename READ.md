# Building Security System

## Project Overview

This Java project implements a building security system where users can authenticate fire and burglary alarm codes using a card-based system. The system involves classes to handle card creation, code validation, and authentication processes.

## Features

- **Card Management:** Create and manage user cards with specific fire and burglary codes.
- **Code Validation:** Validate codes based on predefined rules and update card statuses accordingly.
- **Authentication:** Authenticate input codes against stored codes in the card system.
- **Exception Handling:** Robust error and exception handling to manage various failure cases.
- **Testing:** Includes test cases for validating the functionality of the card system and authenticator.
